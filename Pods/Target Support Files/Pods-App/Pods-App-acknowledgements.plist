address. This licenses may not be split over different Sites. A 
Site License defines the maximum number of concurrent 
Lightstreamer Sessions and the maximum number of concurrent 
Lightstreamer MPN Devices that the set of installed Lightstreamer 
Servers will allow. In case more than one Site License is 
purchased, the aggregated maximum number of concurrent 
Lightstreamer Sessions and concurrent Lightstreamer MPN Devices 
may be split over different Sites. A License File, to be installed 
on Lightstreamer Server, is provided by Licensor to Licensee for 
each machine. Each License File contains the MAC address of one of

Lightstreamer Sessions and Lightstreamer MPN Devices in each 
ten-minute slot of server operation. Licensee must make sure that 
the time difference among the clocks of the machines hosting 
Lightstreamer Server is maximum 60 seconds (while respecting each 
time zone). Licensee must ensure that the Audit Log files for 
every instance of Lightstreamer Server are regularly collected and 
not altered. For each ten-minute time slot, the average numbers of 
Lightstreamer Sessions across all the server instances will be 
summed, leading to a single time series. Every six months, 
calculated from the beginning of validity of the contract, the 
99th percentile will be extracted from the time series covering 
the past six months and the resulting value will be assumed as the 
maximum number of utilized Lightstreamer Sessions. For each 
ten-minute time slot, the average numbers of Lightstreamer MPN 
Devices across all the server instances will be summed, leading to 
a single time series. Every six months, calculated from the 
beginning of validity of the contract, the 99th percentile will be 
extracted from the time series covering the past six months and 
the resulting value will be assumed as the maximum number of 
utilized Lightstreamer MPN Devices.
	(viii) Lightstreamer Time-Limited Site Stand-By License. The 
Time-Limited Site Stand-By License is to be used solely for the 
purpose of deploying a mirror stand-by site in conjunction with a 
valid Time-Limited Site License and must be used only for disaster 
recovery purpose and not to balance users' connections among 
sites. One License is for an installation on a single geographical 
site, on an arbitrary number of machines located on that site. 
This means that all the machines can be in different offices but 
must be based at the same address. A License File, to be installed 
on Lightstreamer Server, is provided by Licensor to Licensee for 
each machine. Each License File contains the MAC address of one of 
the network cards of the machine on which Lightstreamer Server is 
installed. The License will expire at the end of the period for 
which it was purchased and the software will stop working 15 
(fifteen) days after expiration. In any case, attempts to use the 
License after its expiration are expressively prohibited. During 
the License validity period Licensee must provide Licensor, at 
least every 6 (six) months starting from the effective date of 
this Agreement, with the Audit Log files for all the deployed 
instances of Lightstreamer Server. The Audit Log files must be 
delivered by Licensee to Licensor, via the means made available by 
Licensor, including automatic upload as described in Art. 1.8 
below, within 15 (fifteen) days from the expiration of the 6-month 
period. The Audit Log files will be processed in the same way as 
defined for the Lightstreamer Time-Limited Site License.

installation on a single geographical site, on an arbitrary number 
of machines located on that site. This means that all the machines 
can be in different offices but must be based at the same address. 
This license may not be split over different Sites. A Site License 
defines the maximum number of concurrent Lightstreamer Sessions 
and the maximum number of concurrent Lightstreamer MPN Devices 
that the set of installed Lightstreamer Servers will allow. In 
case more than one Site License is purchased, the aggregated 
maximum number of concurrent Lightstreamer Sessions and concurrent 
Lightstreamer MPN Devices may be split over different Sites. A 
License File, to be installed on Lightstreamer Server, is provided 
by Licensor to Licensee for each machine. Each License File 
contains the MAC address of one of the network cards of the 
machine on which Lightstreamer Server is installed. The License 
has no expiration. Licensee must provide Licensor, at least every 
6 (six) months starting from the effective date of this Agreement, 
with the Audit Log files for all the installed instances of 
Lightstreamer Server. The Audit Log files must be delivered by 
Licensee to Licensor, via the means made available by Licensor, 
including automatic upload as described in Art. 1.8 below, within 
15 (fifteen) days from the expiration of the 6-month period. The 
Audit Log files report the average number of Lightstreamer 
Sessions and concurrent Lightstreamer MPN Devices in each 
ten-minute slot of server operation. Licensee must make sure that 
the time difference among the clocks of the machines hosting 
Lightstreamer Server is maximum 60 seconds (while respecting each 
time zone). Licensee must ensure that the Audit Log files for 
every instance of Lightstreamer Server are regularly collected and 
not altered. For each ten-minute time slot, the average numbers of 
Lightstreamer Sessions across all the server instances will be 
summed, leading to a single time series. Every six months, 
calculated from the beginning of validity of the contract, the 
99th percentile will be extracted from the time series covering 
the past six months and the resulting value will be assumed as the 
maximum number of utilized Lightstreamer Sessions. For each 
ten-minute time slot, the average numbers of Lightstreamer MPN 
Devices across all the server instances will be summed, leading to 
a single time series. Every six months, calculated from the 
beginning of validity of the contract, the 99th percentile will be 
extracted from the time series covering the past six months and 
the resulting value will be assumed as the maximum number of 
utilized Lightstreamer MPN Devices.
	(x) Lightstreamer Perpetual Site Stand-By License. The Perpetual 
Site Stand-By License is to be used solely for the purpose of 
deploying a mirror stand-by site in conjunction with a valid

License is for an installation on a single geographical site, on 
an arbitrary number of machines located on that site. This means 
that all the machines can be in different offices but must be 
based at the same address. A License File, to be installed on 
Lightstreamer Server, is provided by Licensor to Licensee for each 
machine. Each License File contains the MAC address of one of the 
network cards of the machine on which Lightstreamer Server is 
installed. The License has no expiration. Licensee must provide 
Licensor, at least every 6 (six) months starting from the 
effective date of this Agreement, with the Audit Log files for all 
the deployed instances of Lightstreamer Server. The Audit Log 
files must be delivered by Licensee to Licensor, via the means 
made available by Licensor, including automatic upload as 
described in Art. 1.8 below, within 15 (fifteen) days from the 
expiration of the 6-month period. The Audit Log files will be 
processed in the same way as defined for the Lightstreamer 
Perpetual Site License.

Perpetual Development and Test License is to be used solely for 
the purpose of developing and testing Licensee&#8217;s applications, and 
not for any other purpose. If you use Lightstreamer under this 
license for any commercial or free production purposes, you must 
contact the Licensor or to obtain the appropriate license. 
Licensor may audit Licensee&#8217;s use of Lightstreamer. One License is 
required for each deployed instance of Lightstreamer Server 
(irrespective of the number of CPUs, the number of concurrent 
Lightstreamer Sessions, and the number of concurrent Lightstreamer 
MPN Devices). A License File, to be installed on Lightstreamer 
Server, is provided by Licensor to Licensee for each License. Each 
License File contains the MAC address of one of the network cards 
of the machine on which Lightstreamer Server is installed. A

3.5 hours. After this time, the Server shuts down and needs to be 
restarted.
	- Three times an hour, a message may be broadcast to connected 
clients to notify them that a Development License is in use.
	(xii) Lightstreamer Perpetual Demo License. The Perpetual Demo 
License is to be used solely for the purposes of evaluating 
Lightstreamer, developing and testing Lightstreamer-based 
applications, demonstrating a prototype of Licensee&#8217;s application, 
and not for any other purpose. If you use Lightstreamer under this 
license for any commercial or free production purpose, you must 
contact the Licensor to obtain the appropriate license. Licensor 
may audit Licensee&#8217;s use of Lightstreamer. The Perpetual Demo 
License is the default license pre-configured on Software and has 
the following limitations:
	- The allowed maximum number of concurrent Lightstreamer Sessions 
is 20 (twenty).
	- The allowed maximum number of concurrent Lightstreamer MPN 
Devices is 20 (twenty).
	(xiii) Lightstreamer Time-Limited Evaluation License. The 
Lightstreamer Time-Limited Evaluation License is to be used solely 
for the purpose of evaluating Lightstreamer without the limitation 
on the number of Lightstreamer Sessions posed by the Lightstreamer 
Perpetual Demo License, and not for any other purpose. If you use 
Lightstreamer under this license for any commercial or free 
production purpose, you must contact the Licensor to obtain the 
appropriate license. Licensor may audit Licensee&#8217;s use of 
Lightstreamer. A ClientID string, to be configured on 
Lightstreamer Server, is provided by Licensor to Licensee for each 
License. The Lightstreamer Evaluation License has an expiration 
date controlled by Licensor. In order to check the license 
validity and enable its use, Lightstreamer Server will 
periodically connect to Licensor&#8217;s servers through the Internet. 
As part of such online license check, Lightstreamer Server will 
send Licensor's servers some statistics (such as number of 
sessions, used bandwidth, etc.). The duration of an Evaluation 
License is usually 60 (sixty) days from the date of ClientID 
delivery, but it can be reduced or extended at Licensor&#8217;s 
discretion. Licensee is responsible to hold in confidence the 
assigned CliendID and not to disclose to any person other than 
directly concerned with purposes of the evaluation.
	(xiv) Lightstreamer Non-Production Full Licenses. The 
Lightstreamer Non-Production Full Licenses can only be installed 
and used to support Licensee's use of a production license 
belonging to contract types 1.6 (i), (iii), (v) or (vi). 
Lightstreamer Non-Production Full Licenses have the same 
characteristics described for the corresponding production 
license, but can only be deployed as part of Licensee's internal 
development and test environment for internal non-production 
activities, including but not limited to testing, performance 
tuning, fault diagnosis, internal benchmarking, staging, quality 
assurance activity and/or developing internally used additions or 
extensions using published application programming interfaces. 
Licensee is not authorized to use any part of the Lightstreamer 
Non-Production Full Software for any other purposes without 
acquiring the appropriate production entitlements. Licensor may 
audit Licensee's use of Lightstreamer.
1.7	Lightstreamer Server might periodically attempt to connect to 
Licensor's servers through the Internet to automatically check the 
availability of software updates; when this even occurs, Licensee is 
notified. Such mechanism can be disabled at Licensee's discretion.
1.8	Lightstreamer Server might periodically attempt to connect to 
Licensor's servers through the Internet to automatically upload the 
Audit Log file, in case of contract types 1.6 (vii), (viii), (ix), 
and (x). Such mechanism can be disabled at Licensee's discretion. In 
case Licensee relies on such mechanism to deliver the Audit Log files 
to Licensor, Licensee shall make sure that the automatic upload is 
properly configured and is working correctly.

In the event that the termination occurs in the warranty period, the 
licensee fee will be proportional with the duration of the contract.
