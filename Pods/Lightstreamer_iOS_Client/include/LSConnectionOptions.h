 polling mode can be forced by setting #forcedTransport to "WS-POLLING" or "HTTP-POLLING".
 <br/> The polling interval affects the rate at which polling requests are issued. It is the time between the start of a polling request and the start of 
 the next request. However, if the polling interval expires before the first polling request has returned, then the second polling request is delayed. This 
 may happen, for instance, when the Server delays the answer because of the idle timeout setting. In any case, the polling interval allows for setting an upper 
 limit on the polling frequency.
 <br/> The Server does not impose a lower limit on the client polling interval. However, in some cases, it may protect itself against a high polling rate by 
 delaying its answer. Network limitations and configured bandwidth limits may also lower the polling rate, despite of the client polling interval.
