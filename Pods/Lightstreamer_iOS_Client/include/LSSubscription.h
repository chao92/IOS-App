/**
 @brief Class representing a Subscription to be submitted to a Lightstreamer Server.
 <br/> It contains subscription details and the delegates needed to process the real-time data.
 <br/> After the creation, an LSSubscription object is in the "inactive" state. When a Subscription object is subscribed to on a LSLightstreamerClient object, 
 through the LSLightstreamerClient#subscribe: method, its state becomes "active". This means that the client activates a subscription to the required items 
 through Lightstreamer Server and the LSSubscription object begins to receive real-time events.
 <br/> A Subscription can be configured to use either an Item Group or an Item List to specify the items to be subscribed to and using either a Field Schema 
 or Field List to specify the fields.
 <br/> "Item Group" and "Item List" are defined as follows: <ul> 
 <li>"Item Group": an Item Group is a String identifier representing a list of items. Such Item Group has to be expanded into a list of items by the 
 getItems method of the MetadataProvider of the associated Adapter Set. When using an Item Group, items in the subscription are identified by their 
 1-based index within the group.
 <br/> It is possible to configure the LSSubscription to use an "Item Group" using the #itemGroup property.</li>
 <li>"Item List": an Item List is an array of Strings each one representing an item. For the Item List to be correctly interpreted a LiteralBasedProvider or 
 a MetadataProvider with a compatible implementation of getItems has to be configured in the associated Adapter Set.
 <br/> Note that no item in the list can be empty, can contain spaces or can be a number.
 <br/> When using an Item List, items in the subscription are identified by their name or by their 1-based index within the list.
 <br/> It is possible to configure the Subscription to use an "Item List" using the #items property or by specifying it in the constructor.</li> 
 </ul> 
 "Field Schema" and "Field List" are defined as follows: <ul> 
 <li>"Field Schema": a Field Schema is a String identifier representing a list of fields. Such Field Schema has to be expanded into a list of fields by 
 the getFields method of the MetadataProvider of the associated Adapter Set. When using a Field Schema, fields in the subscription are identified by 
 their 1-based index within the schema.
 <br/> It is possible to configure the LSSubscription to use a "Field Schema" using the #fieldSchema property.</li> 
 <li>"Field List": a Field List is an array of Strings each one representing a field. For the Field List to be correctly interpreted a LiteralBasedProvider or 
 a MetadataProvider with a compatible implementation of getFields has to be configured in the associated Adapter Set.
 <br/> Note that no field in the list can be empty, can contain spaces or can be a number.
 <br/> When using a Field List, fields in the subscription are identified by their name or by their 1-based index within the list.</li> 
 </ul> It is possible to configure the LSSubscription to use a "Field List" using the #fields property or by specifying it in the constructor.
