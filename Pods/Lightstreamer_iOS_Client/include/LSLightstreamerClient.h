- (void) sendMessage:(nonnull NSString *)message;

/**
 @brief Operation method that sends a message to the Server.
 <br/> The message is interpreted and handled by the Metadata Adapter associated to the current Session. This operation supports in-order guaranteed message delivery
 with automatic batching. In other words, messages are guaranteed to arrive exactly once and respecting the original order, whatever is the underlying transport 
 (HTTP or WebSockets). Furthermore, high frequency messages are automatically batched, if necessary, to reduce network round trips.
 <br/> Upon subsequent calls to the method, the sequential management of the involved messages is guaranteed. The ordering is determined by the order in which 
 the calls to sendMessage are issued. However, any message that, for any reason, doesn't reach the Server can be discarded by the Server if this causes the 
 subsequent message to be kept waiting for longer than a configurable timeout. Note that, because of the asynchronous transport of the requests, if a zero or very 
 low timeout is set for a message, it is not guaranteed that the previous message can be processed, even if no communication issues occur.
 <br/> Sequence identifiers can also be associated with the messages. In this case, the sequential management is restricted to all subsets of messages with the 
 same sequence identifier associated.
 <br/> Notifications of the operation outcome can be received by supplying a suitable delegate. The supplied delegate is guaranteed to be eventually invoked;
 delegates associated with a sequence are guaranteed to be invoked sequentially.
 <br/> The "UNORDERED_MESSAGES" sequence name has a special meaning. For such a sequence, immediate processing is guaranteed, while strict ordering and even 
 sequentialization of the processing is not enforced. Likewise, strict ordering of the notifications is not enforced. However, messages that, for any reason, 
 should fail to reach the Server whereas subsequent messages had succeeded, might still be discarded after a server-side timeout.
 Since a message is handled by the Metadata Adapter associated to the current connection, a message can be sent only if a connection is currently active. 
 If the special enqueueWhileDisconnected flag is specified it is possible to call the method at any time and the client will take care of sending the message 
 as soon as a connection is available, otherwise, if the current status is "DISCONNECTED*", the message will be abandoned and the 
 LSClientMessageDelegate#messageDidAbort event will be fired.
 <br/> Note that, in any case, as soon as the status switches again to "DISCONNECTED*", any message still pending is aborted, including messages that were queued 
 with the enqueueWhileDisconnected flag set to true.
 <br/> Also note that forwarding of the message to the server is made in a separate thread, hence, if a message is sent while the connection is active, it could 
 be aborted because of a subsequent disconnection. In the same way a message sent while the connection is not active might be sent because of a subsequent connection.
 @param message a text message, whose interpretation is entirely demanded to the Metadata Adapter associated to the current connection.
 @param sequence an alphanumeric identifier, used to identify a subset of messages to be managed in sequence; underscore characters are also allowed. 
 If the "UNORDERED_MESSAGES" identifier is supplied, the message will be processed in the special way described above. The parameter is optional; 
 if set to nil, "UNORDERED_MESSAGES" is used as the sequence name.
 @param delayTimeout a timeout, expressed in seconds. If higher than the Server default timeout, the latter will be used instead.
 <br/> The parameter is optional; if 0 is supplied, the Server default timeout will be applied.
 <br/> This timeout is ignored for the special "UNORDERED_MESSAGES" sequence, for which a custom server-side timeout applies.
 @param delegate an object suitable for receiving notifications about the processing outcome. The parameter is optional; if not supplied,
 no notification will be available.
 <br/> Note: delegates are stored with weak references: make sure you keep a strong reference to your delegates or they may be released prematurely.
 @param enqueueWhileDisconnected if this flag is set to true, and the client is in a disconnected status when the provided message is handled, then the message
 is not aborted right away but is queued waiting for a new session. Note that the message can still be aborted later when a new session is established.
