 @brief Name of the Adapter Set (which defines the Metadata Adapter and one or several Data Adapters) mounted on Lightstreamer Server that supply all the items

 <br/> An Adapter Set defines the Metadata Adapter and one or several Data Adapters. It is configured on the server side through an "adapters.xml" file; 
 the name is configured through the "id" attribute in the <adapters_conf> element. The default Adapter Set, configured as "DEFAULT" on the Server.
 The Adapter Set name should be set on the LightstreamerClient#connectionDetails object before calling the LightstreamerClient#connect method. However, the value 
 can be changed at any time: the supplied value will be used for the next time a new session is requested to the server.
 <br/> This setting can also be specified in the LSLightstreamerClient constructor. A nil value is equivalent to the "DEFAULT" name.

 @brief Configured address of Lightstreamer Server.
 <br/> Note that the addresses specified must always have the http: or https: scheme. In case WebSockets are used, the specified scheme is internally converted to 
 match the related WebSocket protocol (i.e. http becomes ws while https becomes wss). WSS/HTTPS connections are not supported by the Server if it runs in Allegro 
 edition. WSS/HTTPS connections are not supported by the Server if it runs in Moderato edition. If no server address is supplied the client will be unable to connect.
 This method can be called at any time. If called while connected, it will be applied when the next session creation request is issued. This setting can also be 
 specified in the LightstreamerClient constructor. A nil value can also be used, to restore the default value. An IPv4 or IPv6 can also be used in place of a
 hostname. Some examples of valid values include:<ul>
 <li> http://push.mycompany.com
 <li> http://push.mycompany.com:8080
 <li> http://79.125.7.252
 <li> http://[2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334]

 @brief Server address to be used to issue all requests related to the current session.
 <br/> In fact, when a Server cluster is in place, the Server address specified through #serverAddress can identify various Server instances; in order to ensure
 that all requests related to a session are issued to the same Server instance, the Server can answer to the session opening request by providing an address which 
 uniquely identifies its own instance. When this is the case, this address is returned by the method; otherwise, nil is returned.
 <br/> Note that the addresses will always have the http: or https: scheme. In case WebSockets are used, the specified scheme is internally converted to match the 
 related WebSocket protocol (i.e. http becomes ws while https becomes wss). 
 <br/> Server Clustering is not supported when using Lightstreamer in Moderato edition.

 @brief Instance name of the Server which is serving the current session.
 <br/> To be more precise, each answering port configured on a Server instance (through a <http_server> or <https_server> element in the Server configuration file) can
 be given a different name; the name related to the port to which the session opening request has been issued is returned. Note that in case of polling or in case 
 rebind requests are needed, subsequent requests related to the same session may be issued to a port different than the one used for the first request; 
 the names configured for those ports would not be reported. This, however, can only happen when a Server cluster is in place and particular configurations for 
 the load balancer are used.
